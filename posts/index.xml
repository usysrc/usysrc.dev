d = a ? b : c Ternary by Precedence. In Lua logical operators and their precedence can be used to achieve the same:
d = a and b or c Written out with if it would look like this:
if a then d = b else d = c end If a is true then b will be assigned to d.</description></item><item><title>TIC80</title><link>https://usysrc.dev/posts/tic/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 12:47:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://usysrc.dev/posts/tic/</guid><description>TIC80 - External Editor To get a better experience to edit the sprites and maps while also editing the code in an external editor we can use require
How to require a file Sadly lua require does not work the way as expected in TIC-80. We need to add the package path.

Create a new object in a 2D cell at (i,j) in a table called myArray with the following code:
myArray[i..&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;..j] = {} To iterate over all objects in the myArray you can use the pairs iterator. Caution: the objects are not ordered when using pairs!
for k,v in pairs(myArray) do -- v is the cell object -- k is a string in the form of &amp;#34;i,j&amp;#34; end If we want to access the objects in a particular order we should use nested for loops:</description></item><item><title>A CPU in Lua</title><link>https://usysrc.dev/posts/cpu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2014 17:13:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://usysrc.dev/posts/cpu/</guid><description>A CPU in Lua This post was originally published on blog.headchant.com but was edited and moved here in 2022.
It might be interesting to implement a small register based VM in Lua. Lets start by considering the architecture of a register machine.
The NOP machine If we look at how existing Register Machines are designed for example the or the Lua VM itself, we see a few things:
some registers a program something that executes the program The last part will be the point of entry for the lua program itself but also decide the core features of the design.</description></item></channel></rss>
