# Text Focus Plugin for Obsidian

## My Notes Workflow 
I work ~fast~. 

I want to be able to open [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and throw in whatever is in my clipboard as fast as possible. The usual behavior of Obsidian is to move the cursor to the title and highlight it. So if I want to paste I get into trouble because the title or name of the note does have some restrictions and shouldn't be so long. I want that clipboard stuff always to be in the body of the note! I was surprised to find out that this behavior is not default in Obsidian.

## The Plugin 
I am developing the [Obsidian Text Focus Plugin](https://github.com/usysrc/obsidian-text-focus-plugin) to make my life easier when working with quickly creating notes. It always will put the focus on the text when you create a new note or when you switch from Reading View to Source View.
