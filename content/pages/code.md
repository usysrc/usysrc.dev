# philosophy

I enjoy minimalist and modular software (see [unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)).

# programming languages

I currently use the following programming languages:

```go
languages := [4]string{
  "Go",
  "Lua",
  "C",
  "Python",
}
```

I additionally have worked with the following programming languages in some way or another:

```lua
local otherLanguages = {
  "Javascript",
  "C#",
  "C++",
  "Python",
  "Visual Basic",
  "QBasic",
  "Omikron Basic",
  "SQL",
  "Lisp",
  "Max/MSP",
  "Supercollider",
  "Assembly Language",
}
```

I joined [advent of code](https://github.com/usysrc/aoc) in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.
