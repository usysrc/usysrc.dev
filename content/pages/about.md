My name is usysrc. This website is focused on my technical and digital creations.

Programming is a big part of my life. I enjoy minimalist and modular software (see [unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)).

I enjoy doing some of the [advent of code](https://github.com/usysrc/aoc) challenges casually. 

I enjoy small game engines and frameworks like tic80, pico8, picotron and love2d. Spelltop was created in 2021 and now my main banner for games and game prototypes. Some projects can be found on [spelltop.itch.io](https://spelltop.itch.io). I enjoy game jams and completed a couple of small games in <a href="https://ldjam.com/users/headchant/games">ludum dare</a>. I made games under the name: headchant, hcnt, rdlk. 

I enjoy playing the piano and making computer and electronic music. I made a lot of kraut and synthesizer dance music
[https://rdlk.xyz](https://rdlk.xyz). I made the [soundtrack](https://headchant.bandcamp.com/releases) for orcish inn by steven colling. 

I couldn't find a plain reverse delay vst plugin. [https://spelltop.itch.io/shoegaze-vst](https://spelltop.itch.io/shoegaze-vst) So I made one.
