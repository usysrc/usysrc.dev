[https://rdlk.xyz](https://rdlk.xyz)

# orcish inn

I made the [soundtrack](https://headchant.bandcamp.com/releases) for orcish inn by steven colling.

# shoegaze vst

I couldn't find a plain reverse delay plugin. [https://spelltop.itch.io/shoegaze-vst](https://spelltop.itch.io/shoegaze-vst) So I made one.

Features:

- reverse delay, a staple of shoegaze
- feedback
- minimal interface
- no DRM
- sadly for Windows only
