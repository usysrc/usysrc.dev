kraut and synthesizer dance music

# shoegaze vst
I couldn't find a plain reverse delay plugin. [https://spelltop.itch.io/shoegaze-vst](https://spelltop.itch.io/shoegaze-vst) So I made one.

Features:
- reverse delay, a staple of shoegaze
- feedback
- minimal interface
- no DRM
- sadly for Windows only
